### Underdash JS

`TASKS-DONE` 
- 1.to get an 'inside view' of one of the most heavily used JavaScript libraries, lodash (50m downloads on NPM last month)
- 2.do not use higher-order native array methods such as map, filter, reduce, forEach in your implementation in order to gain a deeper understanding of how these methods work behind the scenes.

#### Development 

- Open the `SpecRunner.html` file in a browser (Chrome is recommended). (`Cmd + O` or `Ctrl + O`)
- Pass each test sequentially followed by`SpecRunner.html`.
- Work with the`src/underdash.js` file.

#### TODO

- [âœ…] complete the functions in `src/underdash.js' files. 

#### Tips

- You should be heavily referencing the lodash documentation to understand how your functions should work. [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)
- "collection" means an array or an object. If it's a "collection" problem, please write your code to satisfy both array and object cases.
